## About the app

All individuals residing in Greece should send an SMS text message to 13033 in order to obtain permission to leave their homes during the lockdown. In fact, you can send an sms in just 3 taps from this mobile app. All you need to do is just type all the necessary data and choose the reason that you need to leave your home. Then, the app generates the right text message for the reason that you have selected. You can even store your data (locally), so you won't have to type them every single time.
